## Defects Found

**NONE** - No defects were found in the original Triangle.py implementation. All 35 test cases passed successfully.

---

## Analysis

The original classify_triangle() function demonstrates:

1. **Correct Triangle Classification**: Properly identifies Equilateral, Isosceles, and Scalene triangles

2. **Accurate Right Triangle Detection**: Uses Pythagorean theorem with appropriate floating-point tolerance (1e-6)

3. **Proper Validation**: Correctly rejects triangles with:
   - Negative or zero side lengths
   - Violations of triangle inequality (a + b > c)

4. **Order Independence**: Sorts sides before checking for right triangles, ensuring correct results regardless of parameter order

5. **Type Combination**: Correctly combines triangle type with "Right" designation (e.g., "Scalene Right", "Isosceles Right")

6. **Floating-Point Support**: Handles both integer and float values correctly

---

## Recommendations

Since no defects were found in Part 1 testing:

1. **Code Review**: Perform manual code inspection for Part 2 to verify implementation logic
2. **Documentation**: The code is well-implemented and could benefit from additional inline comments
3. **Edge Cases**: Consider if any additional extreme edge cases exist

---

## Test Strategy Used

**Equivalence Partitioning:**
- Valid triangles: Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene
- Right triangles: Scalene Right, Isosceles Right
- Invalid triangles: Negative/zero values, triangle inequality violations

**Boundary Value Analysis:**
- Minimum values (1, 1, 1)
- Large values (100, 150, 200)
- Degenerate cases (sum equals third side)
- Just barely valid triangles

**Combination Testing:**
- All pair combinations for isosceles triangles
- Different parameter orders for right triangles
- All positions for invalid values

---

## Conclusion

The original Triangle.py implementation passed all 35 comprehensive test cases with 100% success rate. The code appears to be correct, robust, and well-implemented. No defects were identified during this testing phase.

For Part 2, a thorough code review will be conducted to confirm the implementation's correctness and identify any potential improvements or edge cases not covered by the current test suite.
