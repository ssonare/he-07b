# Code Inspection Report - Triangle.py

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Inspector:** Student
**File:** Triangle.py
**Purpose:** Manual code inspection for Part 2 to identify any defects not caught by testing

---

## Inspection Methodology

Performed line-by-line code inspection using:
1. **Logic Analysis**: Verify correctness of conditions and calculations
2. **Boundary Checking**: Ensure edge cases are handled
3. **Algorithm Verification**: Confirm triangle classification logic is sound
4. **Data Type Handling**: Check for type-related issues

---

## Code Analysis

### Lines 13-16: Input Validation
```python
if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
    return "Not a triangle"
if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
    return "Not a triangle"
```

**Analysis:** ✅ CORRECT
- Properly rejects negative and zero values
- Correctly implements triangle inequality theorem (sum of any two sides must be greater than the third)
- Uses strict inequality (<=) which is correct for triangle inequality

### Lines 19-24: Triangle Type Classification
```python
if a == b == c:
    triangle_type = "Equilateral"
elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
    triangle_type = "Isosceles"
else:
    triangle_type = "Scalene"
```

**Analysis:** ✅ CORRECT
- Equilateral check is correct (all three sides equal)
- Isosceles check covers all three possible pair combinations
- Scalene is the default case when no sides are equal
- Logic order is correct (equilateral must be checked before isosceles)

### Lines 27-29: Right Triangle Detection
```python
sides = sorted([a, b, c])
if abs(sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 - sides[2]**2) < 1e-6:
    triangle_type += " Right"
```

**Analysis:** ✅ CORRECT
- Sorts sides to ensure smallest two are sides[0] and sides[1], largest is sides[2]
- Applies Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
- Uses appropriate tolerance (1e-6) for floating-point comparison
- Correctly appends " Right" to existing triangle type

### Lines 34-63: Example Usage and File Output

**Analysis:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE
- These are demonstration/test code, not part of the core function
- Could be considered clutter but doesn't affect functionality
- The file writing at module level (lines 50-63) will execute on import, which is poor practice but not a "bug"

---

## Potential Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Automatic File Creation (Minor)
**Location:** Lines 50-63
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The code creates "output.txt" file every time the module is imported, not just when run directly.

**Recommendation:** Move inside `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

**Fix:**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # ... existing example code ...

    # Add file writing here instead of at module level
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        for sides in examples:
            result = classify_triangle(*sides)
            f.write(f"Sides: {sides} -> {result}\n")
```

**Impact:** This is a code quality issue, not a functional defect. The classify_triangle() function itself works correctly.

---

## Defects Found

**NONE** - No defects found in the classify_triangle() function logic.

The only issue identified is the automatic file creation at module level, which is a code organization issue rather than a functional bug affecting triangle classification.

---

## Test Results Validation

All 35 test cases passed, which validates:
- ✅ Equilateral triangle detection
- ✅ Isosceles triangle detection (all pair combinations)
- ✅ Scalene triangle detection
- ✅ Right triangle detection (multiple Pythagorean triples)
- ✅ Isosceles right triangle detection
- ✅ Invalid triangle rejection (inequality violations)
- ✅ Negative value rejection
- ✅ Zero value rejection
- ✅ Floating-point value handling
- ✅ Parameter order independence

---

## Conclusion

The classify_triangle() function is **correctly implemented** with no functional defects. The code demonstrates:

1. Proper input validation
2. Correct triangle classification logic
3. Accurate right triangle detection
4. Appropriate floating-point tolerance
5. Order-independent processing

**Recommendation for Part 2:**
Since no functional defects were found, the code quality improvement (moving file writing into main block) can be applied, but the core classify_triangle() function requires no changes.

---

## Decision for Part 2

Given that:
- All 35 comprehensive test cases passed
- Code inspection revealed no functional defects
- The only issue is a minor code organization problem outside the main function

**Action:** Make the minor code quality improvement by reorganizing the file output code, but no changes to the classify_triangle() function itself are necessary.
